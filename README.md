# Welcome! ☺️
Hello there! My name is Sarah Lopez. I'm a student who is in the process of learning Web Development. So far, I know some **HTML** and **CSS**, and I'm currently working on **Javascript.** I also started working on the Odin Project not too long ago.

## So what's your deal? 🤷‍♂️
*Me?* Well, I covered some of the broad strokes, but here are some other fun facts. I am originally from Brooklyn, but I've been living in Central Jersey for the last couple of years. I am also an artist. I have worked as an art teacher, a mural painter, and a portraitist.

I am very interested in the design aspect of Web Development. I want to make things-- not just pretty things, but things that people can use and interact with.
